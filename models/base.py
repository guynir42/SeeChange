class FileOnDiskMixin():
    """Mixin for objects that refer to files on disk.

    Files are assumed to live on the local disk (underneath the
    configured path.data_root), and optionally on a archive server
    (configured through the subproperties of "archive" in the yaml
    config file).  The property filepath is the path relative to the
    root in both cases.

    If there is a single file associated with this entry, then filepath
    has the name of that file.  md5sum holds a checksum for the file,
    *if* it has been correctly saved to the archive.  If the file has
    not been saved to the archive, md5sum is null.  In this case,
    filepath_extensions and md5sum_extensions will be null.  (Exception:
    if you are configured with a null archive (config parameter archive
    in the yaml config file is null), then md5sum will be set when the
    image is saved to disk, instead of when it's saved to the archive.)

    If there are multiple files associated with this entry, then
    filepath is the beginning of the names of all the files.  Each entry
    in filepath_extensions is then appended to filepath to get the
    actual path of the file.  For example, if an image file has the
    image itself, an associated weight, and an associated mask, then
    filepath might be "image" and filepath_extensions might be
    [".fits.fz", ".mask.fits.fz", ".weight.fits.fz"] to indicate that
    the three files image.fits.fz, image.mask.fits.fz, and
    image.weight.fz are all associated with this entry.  When
    filepath_extensions is non-null, md5sum should be null, and
    md5sum_extensions is a dictionary keyed to filepath_extensions.
    If none of the extensions have been saved, this column will be null.

    Saving data:

    Any object that implements this mixin must call this class' "save"
    method in order to save the data to disk.  (This may be through
    super() if the subclass has to do custom things.)  The save method
    of this class will save the to the local filestore (undreneath
    path.data_root), and also save it to the archive.  Once a file is
    saved on the archive, the md5sum (or md5sum_extensions) field in the
    database record is updated.  (If the file has not been saved to the
    archive, then the md5sum and md5sum_extensions fields will be null.)

    Loading data:

    When calling get_fullpath(), the object will first check if the file
    exists locally, and then it will import it from archive if missing
    (and if archive is defined).  If you want to avoid downloading, use
    get_fullpath(download=False) or get_fullpath(nofile=True).  (The
    latter case won't even try to find the file on the lcoal disk, it
    will just tell you what the path should be.)  If you want to always
    get a list of filepaths (even if filepath_extensions=None) use
    get_fullpath(as_list=True).  If the file is missing locally, and
    downloading cannot proceed (because no archive is defined, or
    because the download=False flag is used, or because the file is
    missing from server), then the call to get_fullpath() will raise an
    exception (unless you use download=False or nofile=True).

    After all the pulling from the archive is done and the file(s) exist
    locally, the full (absolute) path to the local file is returned.  It
    is then up to the inheriting object (e.g., the Exposure or Image) to
    actually load the file from disk and figure out what to do with the
    data.

    The path to the local file store and the archive object are saved in
    class variables "local_path" and "archive" that are initialized from
    the config system the first time the class is loaded.

        no_archive: bool
          If True, do *not* save to the archive, only to the local filesystem.

        If data is a "bytes" type, then it represents the relevant
        binary data.  It will be written to the right place in the local
        filestore (underneath path.data_root).

        If data is a pathlib.Path or a string, then it is the
        (resolvable) path to a file on disk.  In this case, if the file
        is already in the right place underneath path.data_root, it is
        just left in place (modulo verify_md5).  Otherwise, it is copied
        there.

        Then, in either case, the file is uploaded to the archive (if
        the class property archive is not None, modul verify_md5).  Once
        it's uploaded to the archive, the object's md5sum is set (or
        updated, if overwrite is True and it wasn't null to start with).

        If extension is not None, and it isn't already in the list of
        filepath_extensions, it will be added.

        Performance notes: if you call this with anything other than
        overwrite=False, exists_ok=True, verify_md5=False, you may well
        have redundant I/O.  You may have saved an image before, and
        then (for instance) called
        pipeline.data_store.save_and_commit(), which will at the very
        least read things to verify that md5sums match.

        Of course, not either using overwrite=True or verify_md5=True
        could lead to incorrect files in either the local filestore on
        the server not being detected.
